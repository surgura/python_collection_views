# Python collection views
Mutable and immutable views over standard collections.

## Install
To be written when the package is released.

## Python support
New releases will support all actively maintained Python versions.
At the time of writing, it is predicted that the next release will target python 3.8 through 3.12.

## Scope
The first MVP will focus purely on an immutable view over a list.
